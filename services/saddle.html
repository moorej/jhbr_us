			<p>Saddle cleaning is more of an art than science. Each saddle has unique needs based on the type of leather
				that it’s made from, how long since the last cleaning, how much dirt has found it’s way in between the
				layers that make up the jockeys and seat, and even the manner in which it was last cleaned. When a
				saddle is brought to us for cleaning we assess the leather and develop a custom solution for each
				saddle. The saddle will be fully inspected and any loose fittings will be tightened, and weak spots will
				be noted. Once we have provided the owner with our assessment and estimate we will begin cleaning.</p>

			<p>The first step in cleaning a saddle is to thoroughly clean it with saddle soap. After it dries, depending
				on the type of leather, it will be coated with warm oil to replace the natural oils that are lost with
				time. If the saddle is particularly old, dry, or the saddle is very light in color a leather
				conditioner, such as Bick, is used in place of oil. If multiple coats are required, they will be applied
				as needed. Padded and rough out seats are given proper attention: rough-out or suede seats are dry
				cleaned and brushed and slick padded seats are carefully cleaned and conditioned. Fixed silver trim is
				carefully polished in place; special care is taken to assure that the silver polish never touches the
				surrounding leather. Any removable silver, such as conchos, are removed before the cleaning processed
				and polished to a brilliant shine. Final finish is up to the owner, anything from a nice oil finish to a
				high gloss. We do our best to make your saddle look its best.</p>

						<h5>Custom Saddle Restoration</h5>
						<p>This saddle is a great example of a comprehensive cleaning and restoration. The saddle was
							inadvertently left out in the weather during the rainy season and then sat out and dried.
							When we received it the suede seat was in dire straights. The leather was extremely dry and
							the silver severely tarnished. Mold had grown over the entire saddle. After thoroughly
							cleaning the saddle a combination of products were used to restore the natural oils and
							suppleness of the leather. The silver was cleaned and meticulously polished. As you can see
							in the after pictures the suede seat is now clean and bright, the moisture and luster have
							returned to the leather, and the silver sparkles.</p>
